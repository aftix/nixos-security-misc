# Enhance security settings for NixOS

## Motivation

This flake provides a NixOS module to apply configurations from [Kicksecure's security-misc](https://github.com/Kicksecure/security-misc).
Many of these settings are from the [Kernel Self-Protection Project recommendations](https://kspp.github.io/Recommended_Settings).
